    <h1>Task 3</h1>
    <p>
        You are given the same quote that you ended up with in the previous task, but it is somewhat broken! We want you to fix and update it, like so:
        <ul>
            <li> Change the casing to correct sentence case (all lowercase, except for upper case first letter). Store the new quote in a variable called <b>fixedQuote</b>. </li>
            <li> In <b>fixedQuote</b>, replace "green eggs and ham" with another food that you really don't like.  </li>
            <li> Add a period to the end of the quote, and save the final version in a variable called <b>finalQuote</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
