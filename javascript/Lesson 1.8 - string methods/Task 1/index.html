            <li> Look up the other half of the quote, and add it to the example inside a variable called <b>quoteEnd</b>. </li>
            <li> Concatenate the two strings together to make a single string containing the complete quote. Save the result inside a variable called <b>finalQuote </b>.  </li>
        </ul>
