    <h1>Task 2</h1>
    <p>
        In this task you are provided with two variables, quote and substring, which contain two strings. We would like you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Retrieve the length of the quote, and store it in a variable called <b>quoteLength</b>.</li>
            <li>Find the index position where substring appears in quote, and store that value in a variable called <b>index</b>.</li>
            <li>Use a combination of the variables you have and available string properties/methods to trim down the original quote to "I do not like green eggs and ham.", and store it in a variable called <b>revisedQuote</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
