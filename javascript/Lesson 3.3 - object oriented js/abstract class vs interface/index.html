        <p>
            This example is about an abstract class, which can serve as a base class, and it allows you to provide default behavior while requiring subclasses to implement certain methods. <br />
            Even though JavaScript does not allow abstract classes natively, it's possible emulate them using classes and erros. <br />
            For this example I'm usign the Animal and Dog classes used on inheritance vs encapsulation. But this time is to demonstrate an abstract class.
        </p>
        <div id="abstract">
            <p><b>Output: </b></p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="interface_section">
        <h1>Interface</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript doesn't natively support interfaces like TypeScript or other languages. 
            However, it is possible to simulate them by defining an interface-like object or using comments/documentation to specify required methods. <br />
            For this example I created a bird interface.
        </p>
        <div id="interface">
            <p><b>Output: </b></p>
        </div>
    </section>
