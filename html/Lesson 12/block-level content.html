                Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.<br /> 
                It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. <br />
                HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. <br />
